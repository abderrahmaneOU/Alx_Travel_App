# Alx Travel App

This project was initialized as a Django web application for managing travel listings.

What has been done so far:

- Created the Django project and app folder structure.
- Added placeholder files for project configuration and the listings app.
- Set up initial files: `settings.py`, `urls.py`, `wsgi.py`, `asgi.py`, and app files like `models.py`, `views.py`, etc.
- Added `.env` and `requirement.txt` for environment variables and dependencies.

Next, I will start implementing my models, views, and other Django features to build out the application's functionality.
